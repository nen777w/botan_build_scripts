# botan_build_scripts
The "botan" library politics do not support back compatibilities and remove old algorithms from the library. Sometimes there is a need to have old algorithms with new algorithms, but it's not a possibility due to compilation and link problems. This build scripts intended to solve that problem by rename all cross names so that for the compiler it looks like a set of separates libraries.
